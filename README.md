# noo-ci

Open source next generation continuous integration server.

## Goal
To create an open source next generation Continuous Integration server that builds upon the great work done by Hudson/Jenkins but is unencumbered with the legacy of the system.

## Overview
noo-ci will support the following:
* All builds run in a docker container
* Git as initial vcs system
* Configuration in code (ala Travis, Shippable)
